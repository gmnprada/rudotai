# The Bored Geometry
Here is an overview of the basic 2D shapes and their geometry:

Point: A point is a location in space that has no size, dimension or shape.

Line: A line is a set of points that extend infinitely in both directions. It has length, but no width or thickness. Lines can be straight or curved.

Ray: A ray is a part of a line that starts at a point (called the endpoint) and extends infinitely in one direction.

Line segment: A line segment is a part of a line that has two endpoints. It has length, but no width or thickness.

Circle: A circle is a set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a given point called the center. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius. The distance across the circle through the center is called the diameter.

Triangle: A triangle is a 2D shape with three sides and three angles. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.

Quadrilateral: A quadrilateral is a 2D shape with four sides and four angles. Examples of quadrilaterals include rectangles, squares, parallelograms, rhombuses, and trapezoids.

Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. Opposite sides are parallel and congruent in length.

Square: A square is a rectangle with all four sides congruent in length.

Parallelogram: A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel and congruent in length.

Rhombus: A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides congruent in length. Opposite sides are parallel.

Trapezoid: A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides. The other two sides are not parallel.

These are the basic 2D shapes and their geometry. They are the foundation for more complex shapes and concepts in geometry.


## Triangle Math Data
Here's an example of polygon math data for a triangle:

Triangle ABC has vertices A(3, 4), B(7, 2), and C(5, 8).

To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to calculate the distance between each pair of vertices and then add them up:

AB = √[(7-3)^2 + (2-4)^2] = √16 + 4 = √20

BC = √[(5-7)^2 + (8-2)^2] = √4 + 36 = √40

CA = √[(5-3)^2 + (8-4)^2] = √4 + 16 = √20

Perimeter = AB + BC + CA = √20 + √40 + √20

To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:

Area = 1/2 * base * height

We can choose any side of the triangle as the base and then draw a perpendicular line from the opposite vertex to that side to find the height. Let's choose side AB as the base:

Base AB = √20

Height from C to AB = |(7-3)(4-8) - (2-4)(3-7)| / 2 = |(-8) - (-4)| / 2 = 2

Area = 1/2 * √20 * 2 = √20

So the perimeter of the triangle is √20 + √40 + √20, and the area of the triangle is √20.

## Square Math Data

A square is a regular polygon with four equal sides and four right angles. Here's an example of polygon math data for a square:

Square ABCD has vertices A(2, 2), B(6, 2), C(6, 6), and D(2, 6).

To find the perimeter of the square, we need to calculate the distance between each pair of adjacent vertices and then add them up:

AB = √[(6-2)^2 + (2-2)^2] = √16 = 4

BC = √[(6-6)^2 + (6-2)^2] = √16 = 4

CD = √[(2-6)^2 + (6-6)^2] = √16 = 4

DA = √[(2-2)^2 + (2-6)^2] = √16 = 4

Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DA = 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16

To find the area of the square, we can use the formula:

Area = side * side

Since all sides of a square are equal, we can choose any side and square it to find the area. Let's choose side AB:

Side AB = 4

Area = 4 * 4 = 16

So the perimeter of the square is 16, and the area of the square is 16.

# Circle Math Data according to GPT answer

A circle is not technically considered a polygon, as a polygon is a two-dimensional shape with straight sides. However, we can still use math data to describe the properties of a circle.

A circle is a closed shape with all points on its perimeter equidistant from its center. Here are some examples of polygon math data for a circle:

Circle O has center (2, 3) and radius 5.

To find the circumference of the circle, we can use the formula:

Circumference = 2 * π * radius

where π (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159.

Radius = 5

Circumference = 2 * π * 5 = 10π ≈ 31.4159

To find the area of the circle, we can use the formula:

Area = π * radius^2

Radius = 5

Area = π * 5^2 = 25π ≈ 78.5398

So the circumference of the circle is approximately 31.4159 units, and the area of the circle is approximately 78.5398 square units. Note that the exact values depend on the value of π used, which is typically rounded to a certain number of decimal places.

# Polygon 

A polygon is a two-dimensional shape with straight sides. It can have any number of sides, but it must be a closed figure. Here's an example of polygon math data for a triangle:

Triangle ABC has vertices A(0, 0), B(3, 0), and C(1.5, 2.6).

To find the perimeter of the triangle, we need to calculate the distance between each pair of adjacent vertices and then add them up:

AB = 3

BC = √[(1.5-3)^2 + (2.6-0)^2] = √10.76 ≈ 3.28

CA = √[(1.5-0)^2 + (2.6-0)^2] = √7.45 ≈ 2.73

Perimeter = AB + BC + CA = 3 + 3.28 + 2.73 ≈ 9.01

To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula:

Area = (1/2) * base * height

where base is the length of any one side of the triangle, and height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the opposite vertex.

Base = 3

Height = the perpendicular distance from vertex C to line AB.

We can find this distance by drawing a perpendicular line from vertex C to line AB. This line intersects line AB at point D, creating a right triangle ACD. The length of AD is the height we need.

The slope of line AB is (0-0)/(3-0) = 0, so its equation is y = 0. The slope of line CD is -1/slope of line AB = -1/0 = undefined, so its equation is x = 1.5.

The point where these two lines intersect is (1.5, 0), so AD = 2.6.

Area = (1/2) * 3 * 2.6 = 3.9

So the perimeter of the triangle is approximately 9.01 units, and the area of the triangle is approximately 3.9 square units. Note that if the polygon has more sides, the perimeter and area calculations will involve more distances and possibly more complex calculations.

# Hexagon 

A hexagon is a six-sided polygon. Here's an example of polygon math data for a regular hexagon:

Regular hexagon ABCDEF has vertices A(0, 0), B(6, 0), C(9, 5.2), D(6, 10.4), E(0, 10.4), and F(-3, 5.2).

To find the perimeter of the hexagon, we need to calculate the distance between each pair of adjacent vertices and then add them up:

AB = 6

BC = √[(9-6)^2 + (5.2-0)^2] = √38.44 ≈ 6.2

CD = 4.8

DE = √[(0-6)^2 + (10.4-5.2)^2] = √67.84 ≈ 8.2

EF = 6

FA = √[(0-(-3))^2 + (5.2-0)^2] = √34.69 ≈ 5.9

Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 6 + 6.2 + 4.8 + 8.2 + 6 + 5.9 ≈ 37.1

To find the area of the hexagon, we can use the formula:

Area = (3 * √3 * side^2) / 2

where side is the length of one side of the hexagon.

Side = 6

Area = (3 * √3 * 6^2) / 2 ≈ 93.53

So the perimeter of the hexagon is approximately 37.1 units, and the area of the hexagon is approximately 93.53 square units. Note that if the hexagon is not regular (i.e., its sides are not all equal and its angles are not all equal), then the perimeter and area calculations will be more complex.

# Vertex

In mathematics, a vertex is a point where two or more line segments, lines, or edges of a polygon meet. For example, in a triangle, each of the three corners is a vertex. In a square, there are four vertices at each of the corners.

A vertex is defined by its coordinates, which are usually expressed as an ordered pair (x, y) in a coordinate plane. The x-coordinate gives the horizontal position of the vertex, and the y-coordinate gives the vertical position of the vertex. For example, in the triangle ABC with vertices A(1, 2), B(3, 4), and C(5, 6), the vertex A is located at point (1, 2), vertex B is located at point (3, 4), and vertex C is located at point (5, 6).

Vertices are important in geometry and are used in many calculations related to polygons. For example, to find the perimeter of a polygon, we need to calculate the distance between each pair of adjacent vertices and then add them up. To find the area of a polygon, we need to use the vertices to determine the length of the sides and the height of the polygon. The vertices can also be used to find the angles of the polygon and to determine whether the polygon is regular or irregular
